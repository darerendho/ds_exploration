* [Predicting Bike Rental](https://github.com/darerendho/ds_exploration/blob/master/Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals/predicting_bike_rental.ipynb): The goal is to predict the number of rentals a bike will receive base on the features we identified to train on. Thereafter, a comparison of 3 different regressors models: Logistic regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressors.

* [I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]  The goal is to determine whether a loan should or should not be granted to a person.

Keep in mind that the investor is risk adverse and would like a lower default rate on the loans he/she provide.

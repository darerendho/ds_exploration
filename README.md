## Welcome to my Data Science Porfolio

On this page, I log my data science findings and notes on various topics that interest and self-learning. Playing with multiple topics with the majority being finance related. They will be presented in IPython

* [Predicting Bike Rental](https://github.com/darerendho/ds_exploration/blob/master/Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals/predicting_bike_rental.ipynb): The goal is to predict the number of rentals a bike will receive base on the features we identified to train on. Thereafter, a comparison of 3 different regressors models: Logistic regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressors.

* [Data Cleaning of Lending Club 2019 Q1 Borrower Information](https://github.com/darerendho/ds_exploration/blob/master/Lending%20Club%20-%20Credit%20Risk%20Modelling/Credit%20Risk%20Modelling.ipynb): The goal is to determine whether a loan should or should not be granted to a person. User data is cleaned and analyse to determine its usefulness as features in our model. Keep in mind that the investor is risk adverse and would like a lower default rate on the loans he/she provides. 

* [Credit Risk Modelling of Lending Club 2019 Data](): Previously, the 2019 Q1 LoanStatus data was downloaded from (https://www.lendingclub.com/) and cleaned. Reduced the number of columns from 151 to 18 to reduce overfitting. Identified columns that would leak information about the future and cleaned remainding columns to be usable for modelling. Logistc and Random Forest Regressor will be tested

    "Modelling creidt risk has been a well known data science problem. Credit has played a key role in the economy for centuries and some form of credit has existed since the beginning of commerce. I will be using financial lending data from Lending Club to model the credit risk. Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. You can read more about their marketplace here.https://www.lendingclub.com/public/how-peer-lending-works.action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors main concern is to receive an interest on the returns on their investments. Qualified investor can browse loans, purpose of loan and credit scores of borrowers. Once loan is fully, borrower receive the money less Lending Club transaction fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit modelling on the investors end need to be more rigourous to define with higher probability loans that will be defaulted on and those that will be paid back in full. Higher interest on loans equates to higher returns with the added risk of weak financial history of the borrower.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model with be under the assumption that the investor is conservative risk-appetiite.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will further benchmark this against S&P 500 and MSCI World index in terms of Year-on-Year(YoY)"
